# VisionCheckout - Self-Checkout System with Custom YOLOv8 Object Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a self-checkout system using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model for accurate object detection and recognition. The system aims to provide a seamless and efficient shopping experience for customers, reducing the need for manual scanning of items at the self checkout counter. Even though the model shows promising results on this small test set, its scalability currently does not seem feasible.
