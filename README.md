# VisionCheckout - Self-Checkout System with Custom YOLOv8 Object Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a self-checkout system using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model for accurate object detection and recognition. The system aims to provide a seamless and efficient shopping experience for customers, reducing the need for manual scanning of items at the self checkout counter. Even though the model shows promising results on this small test set, its scalability currently does not seem feasible.

## Dataset
This custom dataset contains several subsets downloaded from Roboflow, and converted to YOLOv8 format. The dataset contains 1398 images across 4 classes that are common items found in a grocery store. Each class contains around two hundred to four hundred images. Roboflow was additionally employed to partition the dataset into a 72/18/9 split for training, validation, and testing. The link to the subsets along with the custom dataset used for training will be linked below.
